- **Features Added**:
  - New "Manage Routes" section in the web interface
  - Functions to execute routing commands via PHP
  - Forms for adding/deleting routes
  - Display of current routes

### 8. Documentation
- **File**: `ROUTING-README.md`
- **Purpose**: Detailed documentation of the routing system

- **File**: `readme.md` (updated)
- **Purpose**: Updated main README with routing system information

### 9. Examples and Tests
- **File**: `example-usage.sh`
- **Purpose**: Example commands showing how to use the routing system

- **File**: `test-routing.sh`
- **Purpose**: Simple test script to verify routing system functionality

## Implementation Details

### Bash Framework
All requirements from the AI.md file have been implemented:
- Routes are stored in `/etc/l2tp-manager/routes.d/<PEER_IP>.routes`
- CLI tool `/usr/local/sbin/l2tp-routectl` provides all required commands
- Auto-apply routes when PPP interface goes UP (via `/etc/ppp/ip-up.d` hook)
- Auto-clean routes when PPP goes DOWN (via `/etc/ppp/ip-down.d` hook)
- Systemd unit `route-l2tp-apply-all.service` to re-apply all routes at reboot
- Enabled IP forwarding and set rp_filter loose for PPP interfaces
- System supports multiple PPP sessions simultaneously

### PHP Panel Integration
The web interface has been extended with:
- A "User Routes" section where administrators can:
  - Select peer IP from connected users
  - Add new routes (dst-address, gateway defaults to peer)
  - List existing routes
  - Delete routes
  - Apply routes immediately
- PHP executes the CLI tool with `sudo` (configured in `/etc/sudoers.d/l2tp-routectl`)

### Persistence
- Routes are stored permanently in `/etc/l2tp-manager/routes.d`
- Routes are re-applied automatically on system boot via systemd service
- Routes are re-applied automatically when PPP user reconnects via ip-up hook

## Recent Enhancements

### User Deletion Enhancement
- When a user is deleted, all routes associated with that user are now automatically removed
- This ensures no orphaned routes remain in the system after user deletion

### Route Addition Issue
- Fixed issue where routes were added to configuration file but not immediately applied to routing table
- Added automatic route application after successful addition through web interface

### Route Deletion Issue
- Fixed issue where routes were removed from configuration file but persisted in routing table
- Enhanced `del_route` function to remove routes from both configuration file and actual routing table

### JavaScript Error Handling
- Fixed JavaScript errors related to element existence checks
- Added proper error handling for all DOM interactions

### CIDR Validation Fix
- Fixed CIDR validation regex to properly validate CIDR notation like 192.168.3.0/24

### Duplicate Route Handling
- The system prevents exact duplicate routes (same destination, gateway, and device) from being added
- Built-in idempotency ensures adding the same route multiple times has no effect
- CLI tool returns "Route already exists" message when duplicates are detected

## Deliverables Completed

✅ Full bash script `install-l2tp-per-user-routing.sh` that installs everything
✅ All-in-one installation script for complete system setup
✅ Example usage commands for admin
✅ PHP code (HTML + backend) to manage per-user routes inside the panel

## Notes

- Idempotency is ensured: adding the same route twice will not create duplicates
- Multiple PPP peers are handled simultaneously
- Code is production-ready with clear comments for future administrators
- All security considerations have been addressed (sudoers configuration, input validation)
- Fixed sysctl configuration issue with rp_filter for PPP interfaces

## Recent Fixes

### Route Addition Issue
- Fixed issue where routes were added to configuration file but not immediately applied to routing table
- Added automatic route application after successful addition through web interface

### Route Deletion Issue
- Fixed issue where routes were removed from configuration file but persisted in routing table
- Enhanced `del_route` function to remove routes from both configuration file and actual routing table
- Added proper error handling and warnings when PPP interface is not found

### User Deletion Enhancement
- When a user is deleted, all routes associated with that user are now automatically removed
- This ensures no orphaned routes remain in the system after user deletion

### Duplicate Route Handling
- The system prevents exact duplicate routes from being added
- Idempotency is ensured through built-in duplicate detection
- Different routes with same destination but different gateways/devices are allowed

## Troubleshooting

### Sysctl Configuration
The original implementation had an issue with the sysctl configuration using wildcards for PPP interfaces. This has been fixed by:
1. Setting `net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 2` in the sysctl config
2. Dynamically setting rp_filter for specific PPP interfaces in the ip-up hook

This approach is more reliable and works across different kernel versions.
